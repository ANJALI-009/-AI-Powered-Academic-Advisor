## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- PostgreSQL 12 or higher
- Git

### Backend Setup
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python scripts/init_db.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Documentation

### Endpoints

#### Student Management
- `POST /api/students`: Create new student profile
- `GET /api/students/{id}`: Get student details
- `PUT /api/students/{id}`: Update student information

#### Course Recommendations
- `GET /api/recommendations/{student_id}`: Get personalized course recommendations
- `POST /api/recommendations/feedback`: Submit recommendation feedback

#### Academic Planning
- `GET /api/plans/{student_id}`: Get academic plan

## Machine Learning Models

### Recommendation System
- Collaborative filtering using matrix factorization
- Content-based filtering using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Hybrid approach combining both methods

### Reinforcement Learning
- Q-learning for course sequence optimization
- Policy gradient methods for academic path planning
- Custom reward function based on:
  - Course completion rates
  - GPA impact
  - Career alignment
  - Student satisfaction
